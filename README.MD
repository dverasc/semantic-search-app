this entire repo assumes you've installed docker and have llama 2 (or equivalent model) running locally using ollama, and have qdrant running locally, as well as set up streamlit. 

if you don't have any of those things set up, my write up helps you get that sorted, https://dverasc.github.io/posts/llama-poc/.
